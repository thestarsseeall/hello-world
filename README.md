# hello-world
I don't know how to program. Hopefully this is a good starting place.
I'm not multitalented. I'm not sure if I'm even singularly talented. But I love this world, and I'd like to experience more of it, and see what and how well I can do. Probably won't be successful, but hey, its worth a try, eh?
